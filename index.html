        <h2>
            Khorne
        </h2>
        <p>
            Khorne, also called the "Blood God," the "Lord of Skulls," the "Lord of Rage," the "Lord of Blood," "Taker of Skulls," the "Hunter of Souls," and "Kharneth" among many other titles, is the Chaos God of war, hatred, rage, wrath, blood, martial honour, strength and murder. Its portfolio of interest covers the most basic and brutal of sentient emotions and actions, such as hate, anger, rage, the desire for destruction and the joy of killing one's enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every act of killing or murder in the material universe feeds and empowers Khorne; the more senseless and destructive, the better. However, though Khorne is the god of bloody slaughter, it is also the god of martial pride and honour, of those who set themselves against the most dangerous foes and earn victory against the odds.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name "Khorne" derives from the god's name in Chaos' Daemonic Dark Tongue, Kharneth, meaning "Lord of Rage" or "Lord of Blood." Khorne is the mightiest and the oldest of the four major Chaos Gods, fully coming into existence in the Immaterium sometime during Terra's European Middle Ages in the early 2nd Millennium, its birth heralded by an era of wars and conflict that raged across the globe.

        <h2>
            Nurgle
        </h2>
        <p>
            Nurgle, also known as the "Plague Lord," "Grandfather Nurgle, "Father Nurgle, "Papa Nurgle," the "Plague God," the "Lord of Pestilence," the "Fly Lord," "Plaguefather," the "Great Corruptor," the "Master of Plague and Pestilence," and the "Lord of Decay" among many other honorifics, is the Chaos God of disease, decay, despair, destruction, death and rebirth. In particular, the emotion of despair in mortals empowers the Plague God more than any other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nurgle was the third of the Chaos Gods to fully awaken within the Warp, emerging during the 2nd Millennium in the midst of Old Earth's European Middle Ages, as great plagues swept across the world heralding the god's birth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nurgle is the Chaos God most directly involved with the plight of mortals, particularly Humans who suffer so acutely from a fear of death, perhaps the oldest fear of that species, or any other. While Nurgle is the god of death and decay, it is also the god of rebirth. Decay is simply one part of the cycle of life, without which no new life could grow. In the same way, Nurgle is also the god of perseverance and survival. While those who wish to spread decay and corruption are certainly amongst its followers, there are also those who wish to endure, to become resilient enough to handle the difficulties and opportunities presented by an uncaring universe. Many of those affected by Nurgle's poxes usually turn to the god in order to escape the pain and sheer despair caused by sickness and disease.

    <h2>
        Tzeentch
    </h2>
    <p>
        Tzeentch, also known as the "Changer of Ways," the "Lord of Change," "Lord of Sorcery," the "Lord of Entropy," the "Great Conspirator," the "Weaver of Destinies," and the "Architect of Fate," among many other names and titles, is the Chaos God of change, evolution, mutation, intrigue, ambition, knowledge, sorcery, destiny, lies and trickery. Tzeentch is especially empowered by the desire for change and ambition for advancement among mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tzeentch's true power is sorcery, and as all sorcery flows from the font of the Immaterium, so too is Tzeentch the master of that twisted, chaotic medium of psychic energy. Tzeentch embodies mortals' tendency towards mutability and change, the drive to evolve and manipulate. This spirit is present in the essence of every living creature from the first division of cells in the womb to the ultimate craving for survival.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is in the hearts of those with the strongest desire to prevail that Tzeentch whispers his insidious promise; offering a means of life eternal to those unwilling to accept death and oblivion as inevitable.

        <h2>
            Slaanesh
        </h2>
        <p>
            Slaanesh, also known as the "Dark Prince," the "Prince of Pleasure," the "Lord of Excess," the "Perfect Prince," and the "Prince of Chaos" in the Imperium of Man and "She Who Thirsts" among the Aeldari, is the Chaos God of pleasure, pain, hedonism, excess, perfection and decadence. Lust, pride and self-indulgence are the hallmarks of all who follow it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slaanesh is the youngest of the four major Chaos Gods, having come to full self-awareness within the Immaterium only during the 30th Millennium. The name Slaanesh is a corruption of the Aeldari term Slaaneth (Slaa meaning "ecstasy" or "pleasure" and Neth meaning "lord" or "prince" in the Aeldari Lexicon; hence, the "Prince of Pleasure"), though ironically, the Aeldari refer to this foul entity only as Sai'lanthresh, "She Who Thirsts."
        </p>
        <p>
            Slaanesh is the Prince of Pleasure, the Dark God dedicated to the pursuit of earthly gratification and the overthrow of all decent behaviour, as well as hedonism and pleasure for its own sake. It is the god of obsession, the Master of Excess in All Things, from gluttony to lust to megalomania. Its sacred number is six and the colours associated with Slaanesh are riotous purples, pinks and black. The Daemonic armies of Slaanesh are known as the Legions of Excess.
